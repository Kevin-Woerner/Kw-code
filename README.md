These files contain dozens of mathematical functions I've found useful over
   the years written in a meta-language FWIP.

I got tired of writing a useful function in one language, discovering it
   would be useful in another language, porting it over, discovering some bug
   / glitch in aforementioned function, fixing it in one place and not the
   other, and then wonder why it wasn't working the code I didn't fix.

So I developed a meta-language, called FWIP, with a very simplistic syntax
   that I could write my useful functions in, and then have a computer spew
   out the corresponding code for various languages (E.G. Python, Perl, GNU
   BC, Visual Basic 6, and VB.Net).

Caveat utilitor.
